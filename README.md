# Racketfuck

A simple brainfuck interpreter written in the Racket language

The entire interpreter is meant to be ran from the command line. Having compiled the program or having made it executable by adding `#!/bin/racket` at the top and assigning the correct permissions with `chmod +x`, simply run it with your brainfuck file as the single argument.

This program was quickly hacked together, so the code may not be of the highest standard.
